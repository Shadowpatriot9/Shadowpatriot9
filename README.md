## Welcome
I'm Grayden and I'm here to develop my skills further in my pursuit of becoming a software engineer. 

I currently see myself as an entry level developer with varied interests, but most involve what is discussed below.
My current focus is primary in exploring more of C++ and Python as a programming language by completing intermediate projects that is suitable for these languages which you can 
see in my pinned repos below. 

I don't have a lot of repos published quite yet, but feel free to poke around and let me know if you have any questions about my work. 😃
