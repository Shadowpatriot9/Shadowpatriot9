# Welcome

I'm Grayden and I live out in beautiful Colorado. I have been around a computer since I was 13 years old with my ever-so-fast (not lol) Toshiba Satellite C50 that I had for one year before upgrading to my beloved HP EliteBook 8560w Workstation that I held onto for nearly a decade until swapping it out last year with my current laptop a 14" M1 MacBook Pro. 

When I started with computers, I knew nothing about them (like everyone else) but I started to learn more and more about them through games. I would want to play a specific game on the PC but then realized my computer wasn't good enough for it which led down a path of understanding the parts of a computer, how it worked, how to modify a game, and how a glorious .dll file can get you some cool mods and so on and so forth. During that time I was also exploring various different things in life and wanted to make some cash and to do so, I figured I do something interesting and buy old broken computers, fix them up, and then sell them at a profit. 

Over time, I raised enough money to be able to get my HP laptop which I used for everything and anything; so much so that I would end up playing around with more interesting tools such as CAD tools, IDEs and VMs. Fast forward a bit and I let my overall engineering side of myself be a passion and I go back and forth between different disciplines to figure out my engineering niche of Aerospace Engineering with a core of EE, CE, and ME, and now I'm here; trying to develop my skills in this pursuit of mine more and more whenever and wherever I can.

Now....where do I take this? Well, I'll end it with how I will be using this portfolio. My focus on some of my repos will primarily be more tool creation-based and you may see a fun simulator or something space-related in here. Some of them may be 100 lines, others may be 1000s, who knows but I'll say that if you want to play around with some of the things I make, feel free to. If you are just here to look, then Hi lol. And if you're a professional looking at this like a resume....then go away (jk) :D

Thanks for reading. :)
