## Welcome
I'm Grayden and I'm here to develop my skills further in my pursuit of becoming a software engineer. 

I currently see myself as a novice developer with varied interests, but am mostly involved of what is discussed below.
My current focus is primarly in exploring more of C++ as a programming language by completing intermediate projects which you can 
see in my pinned repos below. 

I don't have a lot of repos published yet, but feel free to poke around and let me know if you have any questions about my work. 😃
